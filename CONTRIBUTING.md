## How to contribute

### ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
- **Node.js** >= 18 and **npm** >= 9 installed on your development machine
- Environment variables configured as per [README Configuration section](README.md#configuration-and-environment-variables)
- All dependencies installed (`npm install`)

### ðŸ”„ Workflow
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. Create a branch named according to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g., `feat/add-logging`)
4. Make your changes following the [Style Guide](#style-guide)
5. Add or update tests when adding/modifying features
6. Ensure code builds without errors and passes lint checks (`npm run lint`)
7. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request against the `main` branch

## How to open an issue
- Report bugs with as much context, screenshots, steps to reproduce, and your environment as possible
- Suggest features clearly, with usage examples
- Open questions and discussions are welcome; just avoid SPAM

## How to open a Pull Request (PR)
- Pre-requisite: code builds cleanly and without lint errors
- Follow naming conventions and use clean commit messages
- Explain what you fixed/created, referencing issues if applicable
- Prefer "small", focused PRs; avoid huge batches

## Style Guide
- **Use English** for code, technical comments, and commit messages
- Use the project's indentation style (2 spaces)
- Prefer TypeScript and modern React (`react-jsx`), follow the Ink CLI standard
- Don't add new libraries without prior issue/PR discussion or consensus
- Comment on complex sections
- Export functions and components using default/export {} as appropriate

## Local Setup Tips
```bash
npm install
npm run build # or npm start
# Be sure to install global dependencies as detailed in README
```
For collaboration:
- Use the Node.js version recommended in the README
- If your change involves infrastructure/paths, test on Unix and Windows
- See package.json and build.js scripts for helpers and automations

## Code Review and Merges
- All PRs need review by at least one other collaborator (or owner)
- PRs left unreviewed for >5 days may be closed (unless an exception is opened)
- Critical bugs have highest priority
- Never force-push to main/masterâ€”use pull requests!

## Communication and Etiquette
- Be respectful, direct, & patient
- Use constructive language in PR/issue discussions
- If disagreeing, propose an alternative with technical justification
- Everyone is welcome to provide input; help review too!

BluMa CLI thanks you for your contribution!
For technical questions, open an issue. For critical bugs: email/fast-tag the owner. Break code, evolve, hackâ€”but always thinking as a team!
