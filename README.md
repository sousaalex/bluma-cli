## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
BluMa CLI is a modular conversational agent and task automation framework focused on advanced software engineering workflows. It runs entirely in the terminal using React (via Ink) for a rich interactive UI, and is architected around a **UI layer** (`main.ts` + `App.tsx`) and an **agent layer** (`Agent` orchestrator + `BluMaAgent` core). It enables LLM-powered automation, documentation, refactoring, running complex development tasks, and integrating with both native and external tools. The system features persistent sessions, contextual reasoning, smart feedback, and an interactive confirmation system for controlled execution.

---

## <a name="key-features"></a>Key Features
- **Rich CLI interface** using React/Ink 5, with interactive prompts and custom components.
- **Session management:** automatic persistence of conversation and tool history via files.
- **Central agent (LLM):** orchestrated by Azure OpenAI (or compatible), enabling natural language-driven automation.
- **Tool invocation:** native and via MCP SDK for running commands, code manipulation, file management, and more.
- **Dynamic prompts:** builds live conversational context, behavioral rules, and technical history.
- **Smart feedback component** with technical suggestions and checks.
- **ConfirmPrompt & Workflow Decision:** confirmations for sensitive operations, edit/code previews, always-accepted tool whitelists.
- **Extensible:** easily add new tools or integrate external SDK/plugins.

---

## <a name="requirements"></a>Requirements
- Node.js >= 18
- npm >= 9
- Account (with key) for Azure OpenAI (or equivalent variables for OpenAI-compatible endpoints)

---

## <a name="installation"></a>Installation

### Recommended: Global Installation

> **Important:** It is recommended to install BluMa globally so the `bluma` command works in any terminal.

```bash
npm install -g @nomad-e/bluma-cli
```

If you get permission errors, EXAMPLES:
  - **Linux:** Run as administrator using `sudo`:
    ```bash
    sudo npm install -g @nomad-e/bluma-cli
    ```
  - **Windows:** Open Command Prompt/Terminal as Administrator and repeat the command

> **macOS:** After global installation, **always run the `bluma` command without sudo**:
>
> ```bash
> bluma
> ```
> Running with sudo may cause permission problems, environment variable issues, and npm cache ownership problems.
> Only use sudo to install, never to run the CLI.

### Setting Up Environment Variables
For BluMa CLI to operate with OpenAI/Azure, GitHub, and Notion, set the following environment variables globally in your system.

**Required:**
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`
- `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (if you'll use GitHub)
- `NOTION_API_TOKEN` (if you'll use Notion)

#### How to set environment variables globally:

**Linux/macOS:**
Add to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent:
```sh
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://..."
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key"
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2024-06-01"
export AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT="bluma-gpt"
export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="..."
export NOTION_API_TOKEN="..."
```
Then run:
```sh
source ~/.bashrc # or whichever file you edited
```

**Windows (CMD):**
```cmd
setx AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT "https://..."
setx AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY "your_key"
setx AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION "2024-06-01"
setx AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT "bluma-gpt"
setx GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN "..."
setx NOTION_API_TOKEN "..."
```
(Only needs to be run once per variable. Restart the terminal after.)

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT", "https://...", "Machine")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY", "your_key", "Machine")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION", "2024-06-01", "Machine")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT", "bluma-gpt", "Machine")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN", "...", "Machine")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("NOTION_API_TOKEN", "...", "Machine")
```

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Global Installation of npm Packages in PowerShell (Windows)
When installing BluMa (or any npm package globally) in PowerShell, you might see:
```
Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"):
```
üëâ **Choose `Y` (Yes) or `A` (Yes to All)**. This will change the execution policy to **RemoteSigned** (only scripts from the internet need a digital signature).

- This is safe for devs: Windows only requires digital signatures for web scripts‚Äîlocal scripts, from npm, work normally.
- Read more: [About Execution Policies (Microsoft Docs)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/about/about_execution_policies)

**To restore the default policy after installation, run:**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Default
```

> **Tip:** Restart your terminal to ensure the variables are loaded globally.

- TS source files are in `src/` and compiled to `dist/`.
- Use `npm run build` to compile and get the CLI binary ready.
- Config files are automatically copied to `dist/config`.

### Main scripts:
```bash
npm run build    # Compiles project to dist/
npm start        # Runs CLI (after build)
npm run dev      # (If configured, hot-reload/TS watch)
```

---

## <a name="extensibility-tools-and-plugins"></a>Extensibility: Tools and Plugins
- Add native tools in `src/app/agent/tools/natives/`
- Use the MCP SDK for advanced plugins integrating with external APIs
- Create custom Ink components to expand the interface

---

## <a name="tests"></a>Tests
- The repository ships with Jest 30 configured (babel-jest) and TypeScript support.
- Test files are located under `tests/` and follow `*.spec.ts` naming.
- Run tests:

```bash
npm test
npm run test:watch
```

---

## Live Dev Overlays (Open Channel During Processing)
BluMa supports a live side-channel that stays active even while the agent is processing. This lets the dev send guidance or constraints in real-time ‚Äî like pair programming.

Key points
- Permissive mode enabled: during processing, any free text you type is treated as a [hint] automatically.
- Structured prefixes are also supported at any time:
  - [hint] Text for immediate guidance to the agent
  - [constraint] Rules/limits (e.g., "n√£o tocar em src/app/agent/**")
  - [override] Parameter overrides as key=value pairs (e.g., "file_path=C:/... expected_replacements=2")
  - [assume] Register explicit assumptions
  - [cancel] Interrupt safely (already supported)

How it works
- Frontend: the input remains active in read-only (processing) mode and emits a dev_overlay event.
- Agent backend: consumes overlays with precedence (constraint > override > hint). Hints and assumptions are injected into the system context before the next decision; overrides/constraints adjust tool parameters just before execution.
- Logging & history: every overlay is logged and stored in session history for auditability.

Examples
- During a long task, just type:
  - "Prefer do not touch tests yet" ‚Üí will be treated as [hint]
  - "[constraint] n√£o editar src/app/ui/**" ‚Üí blocks edits under that path
  - "[override] expected_replacements=2" ‚Üí adjusts the next edit_tool call
  - "[assume] target=api" ‚Üí adds an assumption in context

Notes
- The side-channel does not pause the agent ‚Äî it adapts on the fly.
- If an overlay conflicts with the current plan: constraint > override > hint.
- All overlays are acknowledged via standard internal messages and persisted.

## <a name="configuration-and-environment-variables"></a>Configuration and Environment Variables
You must create a `.env` file (copy if needed from `.env.example`) with the following variables:
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`
- `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (optional; required for GitHub integrations)
- `NOTION_API_TOKEN` (optional; required for Notion integrations)

And others required by your agent/context or Azure setup.

Advanced config files are located in `src/app/agent/config/`.

## üèó Architecture Diagram
Below is a simplified diagram showing BluMa CLI's core architecture:
```
[ main.ts ] ‚Üí [ App.tsx (UI Layer) ]
       ‚Üì
[ Agent (Orchestrator) ]
       ‚Üì
[ BluMaAgent (Core Loop & State) ]
       ‚Üì
[ MCPClient / Tools / Native Tools / SubAgents ]
       ‚Üì
[ External APIs & System Operations ]
```

- **Session/History Save Failures**: Warn user and continue without losing core functionality.

---

## üìà Metrics & Observability
- **Performance Metrics**: Average response time, tokens used per request, tool execution times.
- **Usage Tracking**: Number of commands executed, tool calls, sessions created.
- **Logging**: Structured logs for all events.
- Integration-ready with Prometheus/Grafana or external observability platforms.

---

## üîê Advanced Security Practices
- Use secret management tools (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store environment variables.
- Apply principle of least privilege for API keys.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to avoid prompt injection attacks.
- Regularly rotate API keys.

---

## üöÄ Performance & Scalability
